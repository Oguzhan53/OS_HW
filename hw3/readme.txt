--Part2

Bubble sort algorithm works slowly, because of that Ä± execute part2 program like 
$make
$./sortArrays 4 5 7 SC  inverted 10000 diskFileName.dat
If this number increments then programs execution time will be larger like 3-5 min. "tableType" parameter is not important for program because all pages in the same table in the program, it do nothing for this parameter. But there is have to be 8 parameter.


--Part3

Execution commands
$make
$./program 1 : This command for finding best frame size for each sorting algorithm wiht LRU algorithm.
$./program 2 : This commanf for finding best page replacement algorithm for each sorting algorithm (bonus part).

"program 1" is running a little slowly. It takes about 1-1.5 minutes.
